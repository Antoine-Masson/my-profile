        <p class="centered-text">Let's introduce myself...</p>
        <p>

          After obtaining my baccalaureate (Maths/Physics), I started my post-baccalaureate cycle at the Polytech Nancy engineering school. Quickly, I realized that this choice did not suit me.
          So I decided to change direction and pursue training in a business school.

          While waiting for ParcourSup to open, I wanted to take advantage of this period to gain experience at Air Liquide France Industrie (8 months), as a Customer Advisor.
          This experience was very enriching for me both in terms of the importance of customer relations (and the importance of a CRM), and in terms of collaborative work in a company... In short, an internship before the internship.

          At the same time, I was able to prepare for the Acc√®s competition, which opened the doors to the IESEG School of Management in Lille for me, from the first admission phase.

          After going through a period of doubt, I am finally proud of this journey. This allowed me to gain perspective on my choice of study, as well as to acquire above all formative experience, but also to have achieved my goal.

        <p class="centered-text">
          In life, I love the automotive world, both its history and racing in general, especially Porsche and Formula 1. üèéÔ∏è I also like to understand the things around me and how they work, while continually learning. üí°

        <h2>What about my hobbies ?</h2>
        <p class="centered-text">
          I'm a sporty person. I swam competitively for 5 years. I also like more specific sports such as downhill skiing, which I've been doing for a while, and sailing, which I particularly enjoy, especially when sailing on my own! ‚õµÔ∏è
